\section{INTRODUCTION}

\section{LITERATURE SURVEY}
\label{sec:literature}
According to Zhu and Nandi \cite{zhu2014automatic} there are three primary approaches to automatic modulation classification, these are: likelyhood-based, distribution-test-based and feature based. These will be discussed below.

	\subsection{Likelihood Based Classification}
	\label{subsec:likelyhood}
	Likelihood based classification is the considered the most popular method of classification, due to the accuracy of the classification when the channel is perfectly modeled \cite{zhu2014automatic}. This method requires knowledge of the channel that the signal is received from, which can be derived through evaluating every modulation hypothesis with observed signal samples \cite{zhu2014automatic}.\\[11pt]

	The main likelihood based classifier approaches are as follows \cite{zhu2014automatic}:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item \textbf{Maximum Likelihood (ML)} - This classifier requires perfect channel knowledge and all parameters are known except for the signal modulation.
		\item \textbf{Average Likelihood Ratio Test (ALRT)} - This classifier overcomes the limitation of not knowing every parameter through using accurate models for unknown parameters, making the calculation much more complex when unknown parameters are introduced.
		\item \textbf{Generalized Likelihood Ratio Test (GLRT)} - Essentially a combination of ALRT and ML classifiers, it replaces the integration of unknown parameters (ALRT) with maximization of likelihood for a possible range of unkown parameters.
		\item \textbf{Hybrid Likelihood Ratio Test (HLRT)} - The HLRT likelihood function is calculated by averaging transmitted symbols and maximizing the resulting function.
	\end{itemize}
	These classifiers are well documented by Zhu and Nandi \cite{zhu2014automatic}; Dobre, Abdi, Bar-Ness and Su \cite{dobre2007survey}.

			% fundamentally threaded
			% UHD on one thread
			% each of the feature extraction functions on their own thread
			% classifier on a final thread
		\subsubsection{Libraries and API's}

		\subsubsection{Build System}

			% Cmake because easy, also can be compiled on windows (probably UHD issue, though)

\section{PROPOSED TESTING PROCEDURE}
	\subsection{Simulated Testing}
		% Evaluate system with generated signals
		% See how well it fares with different number of samples
		% Signal to noise ratio
	\subsection{Practical Testing}
		% correlate real world results with simulation
		% Don't make a new program, just use GNURadio companion to make signals to classify
