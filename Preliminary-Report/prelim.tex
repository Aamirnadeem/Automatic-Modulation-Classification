\abstract{automatic modulation classification involves identifying the modulation scheme used in a signal without the decision being guided by an operator. This report covers a preliminary investigation into the design and implementation of such a system. An overview of the relevant literature is presented and proposals are made regarding the details of the implementation of such a system using and Ettus USRP.}

\section{INTRODUCTION}

\section{LITERATURE SURVEY}
\cite{zhu2014automatic} identifies three major approaches to automatic modulation classification; Likelihood-based, distribution test-based and feature-based. These are briefly detailled below.
	\subsection{Likelihood Based Classification}
	\subsection{Distribution Test Based Classification}
	\subsection{Feature Based Classification}
	Feature based AMR has been shown to be non-ideal, but significantly less computationally intensive \cite{zhu2014automatic} than the aforementioned methods.

	There are again three major approaches to feature-based AMC. These make use features derived from either the signal spectrum, the wavelet transform of the signal or high-order statistical representations of the signal \cite{zhu2014automatic}. 
	
	The classification of analog modulation schemes using spectral features is well documented by Zhu and Nandi \cite{zhu2014automatic} as well as Azzouz and Nandi \cite{azzouz2013automatic}.
